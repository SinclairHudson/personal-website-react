howItWorks: This website is built with create-react-app, and is highly abstracted.
  All the data is in one file, and all the styling and structure is in React Components.
  All the pages are procedurally generated, so if I want to add a project, I just
  have to put the information into the data file. I used libraries for the image
  gallery and the Parallax banners, but everything else I coded myself. While
  a lot of people have told me that I shouldn't re-invent the wheel, I find value
  in learning how to build these things by myself.

intro: I designed and coded this website entirely by myself in 2018, but it was
  in pure HTML and CSS. I used Illustrator to lay everything out and get a feel
  for the design. The project got way to large to maintain, and editing the HTML
  files for each individual page was a pain. So, I purchased a book on the React
  Framework, and spun this current website over a few weekends, learning as I
  went.
learned:
- React
- Creating dynamic websites, in which things move, slide, and interact
- Project Structuring for large websites
