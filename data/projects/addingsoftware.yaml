howItWorks: "The design is pretty simple. ChannelAdvisor, the database, accepts\
  \ two forms of products: Standards and Bundles. Standards are for stand-alone\
  \ products, like tents, stoves, shovels, etc. Bundles are for very similar products,\
  \ like apparel that is the same except for size and colour. In each bundle,\
  \ there is a parent and multiple children. The child products inherit most of\
  \ their information from the parent. After the user of the Java Program chooses\
  \ Bundle or Standard, They are greeted with the information page. There are\
  \ around 12 fields that need to be filled out to make a valid product. When\
  \ they are filled out, the program stores every product as an object in the\
  \ system memory. The user can continue to create products and they will be saved\
  \ in the same way. Once the user clicks \u201Cexport\u201D on the main page,\
  \ the program takes all the products in its memory and writes them to a CSV\
  \ file according to the Channeladvisor formatting rules. The resulting CSV file\
  \ can then be uploaded directly into ChannelAdvisor."

intro: In the spring of 2017, I was getting pretty good at Java in preparation
  for the AP exam, and I was looking to apply what I had been studying. At the
  same time, I was given the boring task of adding products to our database at
  ScoutTech. The database was slow, mistakes were frequent, a ton of steps were
  repeated, and it was mind-numbing. So, after doing a bunch of research on the
  project, I convinced my boss to pay me to develop a desktop that could add products
  quickly. Over a year later, that same system is being used to add products over
  twice as fast as the traditional method.

- Agile Development, working closely with the client
- Writing and reading large amounts of data in CSV files in Java
- Object Oriented Programming experience in the real world
