intro: >
  This is my oldest TensorFlow project, which all started with
  a frustration with a horrible voice recognition library. I decided to give
  it a shot myself, using Google TensorFlow. Currently, I have some parts working
  with a sub-optimal accuracy, and I'm looking into different models and
  methods to achieve great voice recognition. You can find all my
  code on my GitHub.

  Currently, I've only trained a word classifier working, capable at
  differentiating 18 different words apart, with about 92% accuracy. The
  idea was to determine where the word breaks were, partition the sound
  file into words, and then classify from there.
