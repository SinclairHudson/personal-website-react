howItWorks: I don't like being slowed down by hardware, so my rig is pretty beefy.
  It has a GTX 1070 graphics card, which is capable of training large neural networks.
  I have an intel 8600K CPU, which is a 6 core processor; it's great for multitasking.
  Couple that with a fast solid state drive, and I've got a pretty fast system.

intro: "Over the last few years, I have slowly built and upgraded my personal\
  \ computer. The project started in grade 10 when I dissected a few old computers\
  \ from my father\u2019s workplace. From there, I slowly purchased and salvaged\
  \ parts for the the next two years, arriving at this system. Along the way,\
  \ I learned a great deal about how PCs work, and how to repair them. I have\
  \ also helped a few friends out with building their own systems. My current\
  \ build dual-boots Windows and Ubuntu."
learned:
- How all components of a computer are installed, and how they all work together
- How to design a cost-effective build that has all the features I need
- Configuring BIOS settings, and dual booting
- File system permissions and formatting
