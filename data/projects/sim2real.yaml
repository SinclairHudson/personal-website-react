blurb: While working at WATonomous, my team and I explored lane detection using
  simulation data and unlabeled real data, performing domain adaptation from the simulation
  to real-life.

  body: As of writing, the paper was accepted into the Intelligent Vehicles 2022 Symposium, in
    Aachen, Germany. I'm likely going to travel there in June 2022 to present our work.

howItWorks: We tested multiple methods. Our highest performing methods featured
  networks that mapped both the real images and simulation images into a shared
  latent space. Then, a detector based on Ultra-Fast Lane Detection would predict
  keypoints in the image from that latent space. Our experiments looked at the various
  ways we could enforce the latent space distribution from simulated data and real data
  to be similar. We tried Adversarial Discriminative techniques with a discriminator network,
  and other forms of cyclic consistency losses commonly used in state-of-the-art unpaired image
  translation models.

intro: Real-labelled data is expensive for AV. There is also a lack of open-source
  datasets for lane detection. So my group at WATonomous set out on a research project
  to create a good lane detection model using only simulation data and unlabelled
  real-world data. This is usually called sim-to-real domain adaptation, and it's
  of very high importance in the AV industry, to mitigate the cost of finding high-quality
  data.
