blurb: This project uses laptop footage to turn off the laptop screen when I'm
  not looking at it.

intro: 'Two problems. I don''t know PyTorch, and my laptop battery keeps dying
  during lecture. The latter has easier solutions. I could lower my brightness,
  reduce non-essential usage, or remember to charge my laptop. However, I''m a
  bit of an AI geek and I had an unreasonable yet simple solution in mind: turn
  off the screen when I''m not looking at it, and turn it back on when I am. I
  just need a simple convolutional net to perform binary classification. This
  will stretch my battery life further, and give me a chance to learn PyTorch.
  Problems solved.'

- header: Weights and Biases
  body: Weights and Biases is a new analytics platform for training neural networks.
    It's like TensorBoard, but better in functionality and easier to use. It allows
    you to compare runs effortlessly, sweep through hyperparameters, and display
    custom metrics. I used Weights and Biases in this project to find optimal
    hyperparameters like the learning rate, and to display performance metrics
    so I could pick the best model. I also displayed a bunch of activation maps,
    because they're really cool. :)

howItWorks: This network is a simple convolutional one, with about 4 layers. I
  use OpenCV to get frames from the webcam, and then run them through the network.
  I then use the past 3 readings to smooth the output. If the network says I'm
  looking away, then I dim the screen through the command line. Otherwise, I keep
  the screen lit. It's only slightly more complex than an if statement in an infinite
  loop.
