blurb: Placing 3rd in UofTHacks VII, Synviz is a wearable device that reads lips.

- body: "There are a lot of things that could be added to this project fairly\
    \ easily. I could mess around with the hyperparameters a little bit more to\
    \ improve accuracy, I could photograph and tag more data, and I could add\
    \ more gestures, like one for skip track. Top priority would be to increase\
    \ the size of the dataset. I created and tagged the dataset myself, in one\
    \ afternoon, in the same room, in the same clothes. Needless to say, the system\
    \ isn\u2019t really robust, since it\u2019s only trained on 1500 similar frames.\
    \ Sigh\u2026 tagging computer vision data is such a bore, but that\u2019s\
    \ the only surefire way to improve my model."

howItWorks: "The system is pretty easy to understand on a high level. There\u2019\
  s an infinite loop, taking images from the webcam that\u2019s attached to my\
  \ wall, and feeding them to a neural network. The YOLOv3 network is nice and\
  \ fast, with enough accuracy to pick up my hands and classify them. The network\
  \ not only detects where the hands are, but classifies them as one of 6 hand\
  \ states: palm, back, flat, vertical, fist, and neutral. After the network has\
  \ given its predictions, it\u2019s just a matter of simple logic to perform\
  \ the audio modifications through terminal commands."
