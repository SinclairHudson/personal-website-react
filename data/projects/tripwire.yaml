howItWorks: The app uses the GPS in the phone for its main functionality. The
  user can set certain coordinates as waypoints, and specify what kind of alarm
  should trigger when the phone came within a specified radius of the point.

intro: 'This was a project I created with three of my friends for EngHack 2019.
  We decided to tackle a light problem: we were all missing our public transit
  stops because we were reading, sleeping, or on our phones. Obviously, we needed
  a way to alert us when we got close to a bus stop or specific location. We were
  all new to React Native, so it was pretty rough, but we all had a good time.'
