howItWorks: Currently, I've only trained a word classifier working, capable at
  differentiating 18 different words apart, with about 92% accuracy. The idea
  was to determine where the word breaks were, partition the sound file into words,
  and then classify from there. However, with a low classification accuracy, I'm
  currently looking into a new approach, using a sequence to sequence LSTM network
  to turn the sound byte into phenomes first. The good news is that I already
  have the data; I wrote a python script that automatically labels and records
  my voice, making data collection easy.

intro: 'During my Grade 12 Year, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with
  an ex-Hydro One electrical engineer, James Whatley, in my Computer Engineering
  12 Class. We learned and then built voltage regulation circuits, amperage regulations
  circuits, full-wave rectifiers, but we were short on time at the end of the
  year. Eager to learn more, I talked a bit with my instructor and we agreed to
  meet for a few days in the early summer to work on another project: the portable
  speaker.'
learned:
- Operational Amplifier circuits
- Using an oscilliscope to debug physical circuits
- Audio signal processing, filtering, and amplifying
- Current and Voltage limiting circuits
- Soldering complex circuits from schematics
