blurb: I spent my fifth coop term working for NVIDIA, doing perception research for autonomous vehicles.

intro: I worked on the LiDAR perception sub-team of the autonomous vehicles organization
custom:
- header: Pseudo-GT efforts
  body: A big focus of my coop was improving real-time detection pipelines for
  use in pseudo-ground truth generation, or auto-labelling. The AV organization
  has a lot of data coming in, and can't hope to have it all labelled by humans.
  So my main project was to take a real-time LiDAR object detection network and
  explore different ideas and methodologies that weren't necessarily real-time
  or safety certified, to boost detection F-score.
- header: Sparse Tensors
  body: LiDAR data is very sparse, so one of my big efforts was getting 
  sparse tensors and sparse tensor networks working throughout a whole detection
  pipeline. For a pseudo-ground truth model, the limiting factor of designing models
  is the memory, not the runtime. In my case, I was limited to 32GB, which isn't a lot
  to work with. Sparse tensors allowed me to reduce the activation size of my
  network by 98%, while improving F-scores. I was using Minkowski Engine, an
  open source sparse tensor deep learning library from NVIDIA, which has great integration
  with PyTorch.
