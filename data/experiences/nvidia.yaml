- header: Anomaly Detection Research
  body: Although I was on the Customer Experience team, I had the opportunity
    to build out two research repositories from scratch. One was for anomaly detection
    in images, using autoencoders. I implemented many autoencoders from current research,
    and tested their performance on client and public datasets. The main idea there
    is to train the autoencoder on exclusively "normal" images, to achieve a low reconstruction loss
    on those sorts of images. The autoencoder is not prepared to reconstruct anomalous images,
    and so a high reconstruction loss correlates with an anomaly. This unsupervised approach
    to anomaly detection will likely be critical in defect detection cases, since it flags new anomalies
    as they arise in the manufacturing process; not only the ones in the training set.
- header: Dataset Distillation Research
  body: One of the things we always struggled with at Darwin was the lack of data.
    Clients would come to us with hundreds of labelled images when we needed thousands to meet
    their requirements. For this reason, I started exploring Dataset Distillation in a 
    research repository for the company. The main idea with Dataset Distillation is that 
    not all data samples are created equally. We can actually optimize the data to be super
    effective at training models. The end goal is to speed up model training exponentially,
    as we require just a few GD steps to achieve results that would take a model training on normal
    data thousands of GD steps.
