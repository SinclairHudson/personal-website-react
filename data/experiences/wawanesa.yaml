- body: "My first proof of concept project was to create a system that helped\
    \ a public relations team informed on the public\u2019s opinions. Using Twitter\u2019\
    s API, I created a system that took tweets with a specific keyword and performed\
    \ sentiment analysis on them. By storing the data in a database, the system\
    \ is able to track Twitter user\u2019s opinions on the keyword. The whole\
    \ project was built in AWS with Serverless. I used AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Comprehend,\
    \ and API Gateway. My Node.js code tied all those systems together."

- body: "I built a similar system for Instagram, but for a different purpose.\
    \ A big issue in the insurance industry is fraud. Thankfully, quite a few\
    \ people incriminate themselves on social media, by posting things that prove\
    \ their claim is false. I designed a system that looks at a user\u2019s instagram\
    \ profile for posts relating to the claim, whether it be travel, automotive,\
    \ etc. This data is retrieved with a flask application, and then sent off\
    \ to a React frontend to be reviewed."

intro: I couldn't have asked for a better first coop. My job was to build proof-of-concept
  projects for Wawanesa Insurance, exploring potential applications of new technologies
  to the insurance industry. I completed three major projects, and was exposed
  to so many different frameworks and technologies. I learned so much, and learned
  while building.
