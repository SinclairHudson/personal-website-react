  body: "The paper I presented was on exploring sim2real techniques for monocular camera
  lane detection for autonomous vehicles. On Watonomous, lane detection was always
  a big struggle for us, because we didn't have HD maps everywhere, and because
  the open-source datasets for lane detection were often too small and narrow.
  A lot of the times, these datasets didn't have the lane line types we had in Canada.
  So my team created a simulation dataset from the CARLA simulator, and then looked
  at using those labelled images along with unlabelled real-world images to train
  a system that could achieve good real-world performance on the TuSimple dataset.
  Some of the techniques we explored were pretty complicated, based upon predicting
  lane positions and classifications from a latent representation in a style transfer
  system. For more information, please check out the paper and code at 
  https://github.com/anita-hu/sim2real-lane-detection ."
