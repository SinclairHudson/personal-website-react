  body: My most recent trip was a 12-Day canoe trip down the Missinaibi River.
    We went from Dog Lake to Mattice, with a lot of rain and whitewater in between.
    Below is a video I made from the GoPro footage and pictures taken on the trip.
    I edited it all in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there's a longer version for those
    interested in all the whitewater.

  \ my father is an outdoor enthusiast. My family goes on a canoe trip just about\
  \ every summer, and recently we\u2019ve been doing whitewater paddling down\
  \ various rivers in Northern Ontario. Through the Scouts Canada program, I\u2019\
