intro: "In the July of 2017, I attended the SHAD Program at The University of\
  \ New Brunswick. SHAD is an educational summer program for exceptional youth\
  \ across Canada, and it focuses on entrepreneurship. It was a month packed with\
  \ fun and interesting experiences. We did robotics, went camping, and organized\
  \ events. I also worked in a team of eight to create a mock business, which\
  \ we pitched to \u2018investors\u2019 in a Shark Tank fashion."
