name: untether
blurb: For my third coop, I worked at Untether.AI. They're a startup that builds
  specialized cards for accelerated neural network inference.
custom:
- body: A good portion of my time at Untether.AI was spent implementing Non-Max
    Suppression using only integer operations. That's so that NMS can be run on
    the runAI chip that Untether.AI is developing.
  header: Non-Max Suppression
- body: This coop was completely remote, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As
    a result, I don't have many pictures. :(

intro: I was on the neural networks team. We were responsible for converting TensorFlow
  networks into quantization-ready graphs, performing optimizations during the
  conversion.
learned:
- Agile software development, fully integrated with GitHub Enterprise
- Quantization and optimization of neural network operations
- Designing, implementing, and evaluating product features
- Building software while considering the compiler, and the hardware that it will
  run on.
