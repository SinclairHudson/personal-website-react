blurb: For my third coop, I worked at Untether.AI. They're a startup that builds
  specialized cards for accelerated neural network inference.
intro: I was on the neural networks team. We were responsible for converting TensorFlow
  networks into quantization-ready graphs, performing optimizations and
  quantization during the conversion. The RunAI chip can only perform 8-bit integer
  calculations, which means the neural networks had to be quantized. There's
  some very clever math to represent floating point activations, weights, and
  biases as integer values. Part of my job was converting common neural neural
  network operations into the integer space.
custom:
- header: Non-Max Suppression
  body: A good portion of my time at Untether.AI was spent implementing Non-Max
    Suppression using only integer operations. That's so that NMS can be run on
    the runAI chip that Untether.AI is developing.
- header: Uncertain Times
  body: This coop was completely remote, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As
    a result, I don't have many pictures.
