  body: Deep learning moves really fast. I was working on the SemanticKITTI dataset,
    which was only released in late 2019. Despite this, the competition gets weekly
    submissions, and more than a dozen papers have used it to evaluate their ideas.
    At Huawei, I was tasked with reading all these relevant papers, and condensing
    the main ideas into a single summary paper. This paper would be a great resource
    for anyone who wanted to enter the competition, and it would also be a nice
    reference for the team. We would be able to easily peruse the useful ideas
    of over a dozen papers, and incorporate them into our own experiments.

intro: For four months in 2020, I worked at the Huawei autonomous vehicle lab
  in Markham. It was an amazing experience; I got to contribute to deep learning
  research, specifically in LiDAR segmentation. I kept up with current research,
  built and ran experiments, and even wrote a summary report.
learned:
- Implementing models from scratch, based on research papers.
- The planning, execution, and documentation of dozens of deep learning experiments
- Analysing a dataset (SemanticKITTI) to create a good train/test/val split, and
  inform different experiments
- Reading a lot of research and summarizing it into useful contributions and interesting
  ideas.
