This repository is where my personal website is built and deployed.
It's a portfolio of my projects, experiences, co-ops, and other things.
It's built using React, with an emphasis on automation and simplicity.
All the projects and experiences are procedurally built from a single JSON file, so the time it takes me to post a new project is minimal.
I built all the components myself, from mockups I built using Adobe Illustrator.

This is an ongoing project, and it's never perfect. I try to update it often, but it often gets neglected because it's not my most interesting project. :)

### For me when I forget how to React:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

### TODO:
- [ ] Automate images. Use python to append to the yaml files, so I don't have to put in the dimensions of images.
