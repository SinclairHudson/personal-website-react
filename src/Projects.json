I decided to give it a shot myself, using Google TensorFlow Maching Learning. Currently, I have some parts working with a sub-optimal accuracy, and I'm looking into different models and methods to achieve great voice recognition. You can find all my code on my GitHub, right here.",

The idea was to determine where the word breaks were, partition the sound file into words, and then classify from there. However, with a low classification accuracy, I'm currently looking into a new approach, using a sequence to sequence LSTM network to turn the sound byte into phenomes first. The good news is that I already have the data; I wrote a python script that automatically labels and records my voice, making data collection easy.",
